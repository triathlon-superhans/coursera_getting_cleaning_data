# coursera_getting_cleaning_data

This Github reporitory coursera_getting_cleaning_data contains the following files:

1. README.md ==> This file
2. Codebook.md ==> The Codebook
3. assignement_info.md ==> Info about the assignement
4. tidy_dataset.txt ==> The genereated file
5. run_analysis.R ==> The R script which  does the following

 * Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 * Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
 * Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
 * Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
 * From the data set in previous step, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
 
The working of the run_analysis.R script is explained in the comments of the script.

NOTE: The zip file has been manual dowloaded to a directory on my notebook:
"C:/Users/Hans/Documents/R/Coursera/data-cleaning/Assignement/UCI HAR Dataset"
In case you need to test the script, i would recommend to download and extract the script to a directory on your PC and store the path into the workdir variable in the script.
